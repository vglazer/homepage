About MATLAB 
------------
MATLAB is an interactive computing environment and a programming language.
Some fundamental functions are built-in, but most are actually implemented in 
MATLAB (which makes them very easy to modify/extend). MATLAB is very widely used
by scientists/engineers, numerical analysists, machine learning people, etc. 
Although and IDE is provided, it is rather cumbersome so you may prefer the 
text-based command line interface (matlab -nodesktop).

-----------
Online help
-----------
Works a lot like man. Type 'help help' for more info. Type help <command> to
learn about a particular command/function.

---------------
The environment
---------------
... - for multiline commands in interactive mode
clc - clear screen
clear - clear variables and functions from memory
path - display MATLAB path
plot - plot a graph
hold - hold plot (useful for plot overlaying)
! - execute external command from within MATLAB
.<op> - perform vector operation op componentwise (e.g. .*)
<function_call>; - do not display result
type - display source for a library function (doesn't work for built-in)
format - display format for numbers
disp - display a message
num2str - turn a number into a 'string'
error - useful for unrecoverable errors
who - display information about workspace variables
whos - similar but more detailed
exist - check whether a variable/function is defined 
which - path to function (if defined)
quit/exit - exit MATLAB

---------------------
Some useful functions
---------------------
zeros - a zero vector/matrix of specified size
ones - a matrix of all ones of the specified size
eye - identity matrix
diag - a diagonal matrix (in fact more general)
length - the dimension of a row/column vector
size - the dimensions of a matrix/vector
abs - the absolute value/modulus 
max - the value (and possibly index) of maximal element
min - same for minimal element
linspace - equally spaced points in a given interval (useful for plot)
inv - matrix inverse
' - matrix/vector transpose
\ - solve linear system
lu - LU decomposition
chol - Cholesky decomposition
eig - eigenvalues/eigenvectors
cond - matrix cond
norm - various vector/matrix norms
rank - matrix rank (dimension of row/column space)
trace - matrix trace (sum of diagonal entries)
rand - randomly sample from a uniform distribution
random - randomly sample from various distributions
roots - approximate roots of polynomial
poly - construct polynomial (coefficient vector) from roots
polyval - evaluate polynomial
